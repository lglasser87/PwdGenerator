# PwdGenerator
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data

I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria

SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

GIVEN that a user needs a new, secure password

WHEN prompted for password criteria

THEN a password is generated
